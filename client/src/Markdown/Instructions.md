# Instructions

## My mission:

> Create a dynamic widget that can fetch and display real-time weather data for a location. 
> It can be the user’s current location, provide an input for a user to enter their location, or both.
> What you choose to build it with and how you structure and organize it is up to you  - we’ve intentionally left it open-ended.
